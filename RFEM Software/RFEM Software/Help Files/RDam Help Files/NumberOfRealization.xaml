    <Paragraph>
        A Monte Carlo simulation involves analyzing a sequence of possible
realizations of the random conductivity field. Estimated response quantities,
such as the mean and standard deviation of the total flow rate, become more
accurate as the number of realizations is increased (for example, the standard
deviation of the estimated mean total flow decreases as one over the square
root of the number of realizations).  Generally, the number of realizations
selected should be as large as one can wait for, but no less than 2 (which
would give a fairly questionable estimate). A value of 1000 (or more) is
recommended, particularly if probability estimates in the tails of the
distribution are desired.

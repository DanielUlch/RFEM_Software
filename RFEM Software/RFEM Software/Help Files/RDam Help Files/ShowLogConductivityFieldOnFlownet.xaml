    <Paragraph>
        The log-conductivity field can be superimposed on the flownet (if the flownet
plot is enabled above) as a grey-scale with lighter regions corresponding to
lower conductivities. Showing the mesh, log-conductivity field, and the
streamlines simultaneously can be somewhat confusing. It may be best to show
only two of the three at any one time.

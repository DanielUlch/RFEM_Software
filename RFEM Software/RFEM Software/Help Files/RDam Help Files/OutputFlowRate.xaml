        Check this option if samples (eg, values computed for each realization) of
total flow rate and downstream free surface elevation are to be output to a
file having extension *.flo. If multiple realizations are being produced, it
is usually good to enable this option since it allows post-processing of the
statistical results. See, for example, hist_dam2d, or the Histograms menu
after the run is complete.

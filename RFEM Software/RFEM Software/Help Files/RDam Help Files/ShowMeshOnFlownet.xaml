        Enable this if the deformed finite element mesh is to be shown on the
flownet. The finite element mesh is deformed to match the free surface (only
the saturated soil is actually modeled). Showing the mesh, log-conductivity
field, and the streamlines simultaneously can be somewhat confusing. It may be
best to show only two of the three at any one time.

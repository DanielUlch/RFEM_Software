        Enable this option if each realization is to consist of a uniform conductivity
field (all element values equal). Note that individual realizations of the
field are still random, however there is no variation within each field. The
value of conductivity used on each realization is drawn from a lognormal
distribution having mean and standard deviation given by parameters provided
in the data file. Note that this option corresponds to infinite scales of
fluctuation in the x and y directions, assuming a short memory correlation
structure, but avoids the numerical difficulties of very large scales of
fluctuation.

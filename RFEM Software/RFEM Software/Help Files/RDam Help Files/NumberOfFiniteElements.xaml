        The earth dam has the following geometry, and may optionally have a drain
at the downstream toe extending along the dam base towards the interior.
The upstream water level is assumed to lie at the top of the dam on the
right hand side. That is, the flow is from right to left.

On this line, the number of elements that the earth dam should be
divided into is specified. In the vertical direction, over the distance yh,
the earth dam is subdivided evenly into the number of elements specified in
the Y-direction (thus all elements initially have the same height). In the
horizontal direction, both the top and bottom of the dam are subdivided
into nxe equal spaces (where nxe is the number of elements specified in the
X-direction) and straight lines are drawn between corresponding nodes on
the top and bottom surface. This constitutes the fixed mesh, used to
determine the measuring points for gradients, fluxes, and potentials, and
the initial finite element mesh. The finite element mesh itself undergoes
an iterative deformation process which locates the free surface and maps
all of the elements to the flow region under the free surface.

Note that the drain, if present, is simply made up of elements along the
earth dam base. Thus, the number of elements subdividing the earth dam
should be selected so that the drain height and width can be (at least
approximately) represented by a whole number of elements.

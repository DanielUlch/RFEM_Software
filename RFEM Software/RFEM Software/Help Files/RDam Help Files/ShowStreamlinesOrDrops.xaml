        The flownet plot can include the streamlines, the equipotential drops, or
both. The streamlines are often useful to see where the flow is actually
taking place. The inclusion of the equipotential drops results in a proper
flownet. If the streamlines are selected to be shown then the number of
equipotential drops should be set to a reasonable number, even if the
equipotential drops are not selected to be shown, since the number of
streamlines is computed internally based on the number of equipotential
drops. The default number of equipotential drops is 10, which is generally
reasonable (too many will clutter the image and too few will not give a
good picture of the flow regime).

        The earth dam has the following geometry, and may optionally have a drain
at the downstream toe extending along the dam base towards the interior.
The upstream water level is assumed to lie at the top of the dam on the
right hand side. That is, the flow is from right to left.

On this line of the data form, the width, height, and conductivity of the
drain is specified. The length units must be consistent with those
used in the remainder of the program.

If either the width or height of the drain is set to zero, or if these values
are left blank, then no drain is provided. However, if non-zero values are
provided, then the drain is assumed to lie along the base of the dam starting
from the downstream corner and progressing towards the right with width given
by the x coordinate specified (first value) and thickness given by the
specified y coordinate (second value).  Since the mapping of element
conductivities to the specified drain conductivity is done by element height
after the mesh is deformed, there may be some approximation to the area of the
drain. That is, the drain itself may not have a perfectly level upper
surface. The initial undeformed mesh is set up so that the drain is
represented by an integer number of elements in both the horizontal and
vertical directions. After elements are deformed to accomodate the upper free
surface, the drain at the base of the dam may be somewhat deformed.

The third value specified here is the drain element hydraulic conductivity.
Since this is typically much larger than the hydraulic conductivity of the
remainder of the earth dam, the drain element hydraulic conductivities are
treated as non-random and fixed. That is, all drain elements will have the
hydraulic conductivity specified here.

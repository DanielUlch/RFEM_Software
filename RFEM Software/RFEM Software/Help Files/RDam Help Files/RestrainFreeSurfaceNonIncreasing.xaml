        Since it is usually true that the free surface is non-increasing as flow
proceeds from the upstream to downstream faces of the dam, this option merely
enforces this condition and will often improve the rate of convergence when
enabled. Due to element distortion and resulting numerical instability, an
iteration will sometimes yield a free surface which increases over some
span. Setting this flag to true, which is the default, eliminates this by
resetting computed potentials to be strictly non-increasing. However, in the
case of random permeabilities, the free surface may not always decrease, in
which case using this option forces the program to converge to an incorrect
result. It is believed that this case is sufficiently infrequent that the
default gives very reasonable results.

See Fenton and Griffiths, "A mesh deformation algorithm for free surface
problems", International Journal for Numerical and Analytical Methods in
Geomechanics, 21(12), 817--824, 1997, for more details.

        Enable this option if block conductivity (the effective conductivity seen by
the entire flow regime) realizations are to be output into a file called
*.cnd. The sequence of realizations obtained when this option is enabled can
be viewed as a histogram plot using hist_dam2d.exe.

The block conductivity is the effective conductivity of the domain and
is defined by

                              Q
               K_b = kmn * -------
                            Q_det

where kmn is the specified point mean conductivity, Q is the flow rate
computed through the soil realization, and Q_det is the flow computed
through a soil sample having conductivity kmn everywhere.

Note that although block conductivity is defined by the equation above as the
uniform hydraulic conductivity which would lead to the same total flow rate as
obtained in the random case, its definition of K_b is not quite correct for
the free surface case. This is because the free surface elevation would likely
be somewhat different under the uniform block conductivity, and so the actual
flow rate would be somewhat different. The authors expect this difference will
not be large, but it needs further investigation if deemed important.

        Here the soil elastic modulus mean, standard deviation, distribution
type, and other parameters are specified. The `distribution type' is
one of

	1) deterministic, requiring only one parameter, the 'mean',
	   ie, the property value.

	2) normal, requiring two parameters, the mean and standard
	   deviation of the property.

	3) lognormal, requiring two parameters, the mean and standard
	   deviation of the property. This is probably the most
	   appropriate distribution for the soil's elastic modulus
	   because it is non-negative, because it does not impose an
	   arbitrary upper bound, and because theoretical results
	   suggest that it is appropriate due to the central limit
	   theorem.

	4) bounded, requiring 4 parameters (see below for a more
	   detailed description);
		- the lower bound, a
		- the upper bound, b
		- the location parameter, m
		- the scale parameter, s

	5) f(phi). This specifies that the soil property is to be
	   expressed as a function of the friction angle having the
	   following form;

		property = a + b*f(phi)

	   where f(phi) is either 1.0, sin(phi), or tan(phi) and a
	   and b are parameters.

The bounded distribution requires 4 parameters, namely the lower and
upper bounds on the distribution and the location and scale
parameters. Realizations of this bounded distribution are derived
from the transformation

   U = a + 0.5*(b-a)*[ 1 + tanh((m + s*G)/2*pi) ]		(1)

where G is a Gaussian random field with mean zero and unit variance,
(a,b) are the lower and upper bounds of the distribution, and (m,s)
are the distribution parameters controlling its shape. When m = 0,
the distribution is symmetric about the midpoint, 0.5*(a + b), with
smaller values of s yielding a narrower unimodal peak. Note that using
m = 0 implies that the mean value is centered on the range. Other
values of m have not been investigated. See also Fenton, G.A.,
Simulation and Analysis of Random Fields, Ph.D. Thesis, Princeton
University, 1990, pg 139, and Spatial Variation in Liquefaction
Risk, Geotechnique, Vol 48(6), 1998, pgs 821 and 822 for further
details on this bounded distribution. The Local Average Subdivision
(LAS) algorithm used to generate sample fields in this program replaces
the G field in Eq.(1) with the local average of G, G_e, over the
element domains (and so the variance of G_e will be less than or equal
to unity, depending on the correlation length and the element size).

If the distribution type is `f(phi)', then the soil property is assumed
to be functionally related to the friction angle, phi, according to the
relationship

	property = a + b*f(phi)

where `f' is a function selected from the following possibilities,

	f(phi) = phi   gives

			property = a + b*phi

	f(phi) = sin(phi) gives the function sin(), ie

			property = a + b*sin(phi)

	f(phi) = tan(phi) gives the function tan(), ie

			property = a + b*tan(phi)

This 'distribution type' is most commonly used for the 'at rest' earth
pressure coefficient, k0. For example, using a = 1, b = -1, and f = sin,
gives

	k0 = 1 - sin(phi)

which is Jaky's formula for the lateral earth pressure at rest.

Note that if phi is random, then so too is the soil property
being set by the 'f(phi)' option. This presents a difficulty, because
the first thing the Random Finite Element Method (RFEM) algorithm does
is a deterministic analysis where all properties are set to their
means. In order to compute this deterministic response, the mean
soil values must all be known, which, in the case where the property
is a non-linear function of phi, is not trivial to find. In this
program, when the function f is 'sin' or 'tan', the mean of the
property is estimated using a 2nd-order Taylor series expansion of
the function and this value is used in the deterministic analysis.
The variance of the property is computed for interest, although its
computation is via a 1st order Taylor's series representation and
is a `point' variance, that is, the effect of local averaging is
not included. The mean and variance of the function f = 1.0 is
computed exactly.

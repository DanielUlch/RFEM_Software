    <Paragraph>
        This entry is used to specify whether virtual samples of the friction
angle, unit weight, and cohesion are to be taken from the appropriate
random fields. What this means is that a site investigation process
is emulated by 'investigating' the simulated soil properties at one or
more locations. In particular soil properties are 'sampled' by
examining one or more finite element properties within the mesh.

If this option is enabled, the location(s) at which the samples are to
be taken must be entered in the subsequent edit box. An option is also
provided to record the (average) sampled soil properties in an output
file (*.sam) for each realization.

In addition, if this option is enabled, then earth forces are predicted,
in either the active and passive cases, using Rankine's theory. If the
fields are sampled at more than one location, a geometric average of the
sample values is used in the Rankine earth force predictions. The
predicted lateral load and resulting overturning moments are output to
the *.cap output file. The predicted lateral loads and overturning
moments are also compared to those obtained via the FEM analysis.
If the predicted load (or moment), multiplied by a factor-of-safety, is
less than the FEM load (or moment), then a design failure is deemed to
have occurred. The estimated probability of design failure is output to
*.stt, for various factors-of-safety.

If this option is not enabled, then Rankine load prediction (and design
reliability calculation) is turned off. This is the default.

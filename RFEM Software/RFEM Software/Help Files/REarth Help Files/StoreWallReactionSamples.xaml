        The `output wall reaction samples' flag, when checked, results in a sequence
of (nsim) computed horizontal wall reaction and overturning moment
realizations to be written to the output file *.cap. The wall reaction is
equal to the load imposed on the wall by the plastic failure of the soil
and the overturning moment is the sum of the incremental forces exerted on
the wall by the soil times the distance to the base of the wall.

This flag is usually worth enabling when the number of simulations, nsim, is
greater than 1, since the output file can then be postprocessed to estimate
distributions and probabilities associated with wall loads. See the Results
menu after the program has completed.

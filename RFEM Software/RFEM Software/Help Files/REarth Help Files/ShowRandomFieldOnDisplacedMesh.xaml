        Enabling this option results in one of the random soil property fields to be
shown as a greyscale image on the soil failure plot.  Low field values are
shown in white. This option is followed by two other options: The first
controls whether the logarithm of the soil property field should be displayed
-- this would probably be enabled if the random field is lognormally
distributed. The second is the soil property type to show on the soil failure
plot -- this must be one of `cohesion', `friction angle', `dilation angle',
`elastic modulus', `Poisson's ratio', 'unit weight', or 'pressure coefficient'
and should be random.

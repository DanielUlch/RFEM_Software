        A Monte Carlo simulation involves analyzing a sequence of possible
realizations of the random soil field. Estimated response
quantities, such as the probability of wall failure (i.e. that
the wall load is greater than some specified resistance), become more
accurate as the number of realizations is increased. For example,
the probability of failure is estimated by the proportion of
failures, p = Nf/n, where Nf is the number of wall failures and
n is the total number of realizations. This estimate has an
(estimated) standard deviation, s, of

    s = sqrt[p(1-p)/n]                                           (1)

This relationship allows the number of realizations required to
achieve a certain level of accuracy in the estimate of p to be
estimated. For example, suppose the target reliability of a
certain wall design is (1-p) = 0.999, that is, the probability
of failure of the wall is intended to be p = 0.001. Suppose
further that the actual failure probability of the designed
footing is to be estimated to within 0.0001 with 95% probability.
Then, if p = 0.001, the number of realizations, n, must be

         z^2 * p * (1-p)    (1.96)^2 (0.001) (0.999)
    n = ---------------- = -------------------------- = 383776  (2)
           (0.0001)^2               (0.0001)^2

which is to say, a very large number of realizations. In terms
of computing power near the beginning of the 21'st century, this
number of realizations would probably take too long to render.

When estimating the required number of realizations, it is also
important to consider the accuracy of the other parameters entering
the analysis (eg. the means, standard deviations and scales of
fluctuations of all soil properties, the fact that the analysis
assumes a statistically homogeneous soil, etc). There is probably
little point in trying to estimate p to accuracy 0.0001 if any of
these parameters are not well known. Note that if an accuracy of
only 0.001 is required above, then only n = 3838 realizations are
required (although it is to be also noted that the normal
approximation of Eq. 2 becomes less accurate when np
        &lt;about 5).

        Here phi, the soil friction angle, mean, standard deviation,
distribution type, and other parameters are specified. The
`distribution type' is one of

	1) deterministic, requiring only one parameter, the 'mean',
	   ie, the property value.

	2) normal, requiring two parameters, the mean and standard
	   deviation of the property.

	3) lognormal, requiring two parameters, the mean and standard
	   deviation of the property. This is probably the most
	   appropriate distribution to use for tan(phi), see below.

	4) bounded, requiring 4 parameters (see below for a more
	   detailed description);
		- the lower bound, a
		- the upper bound, b
		- the location parameter, m
		- the scale parameter, s
	   This is probably the most appropriate distribution to use
	   for phi since it provides for an upper bound on the
	   friction angle.

The bounded distribution requires 4 parameters, namely the lower and
upper bounds on the distribution and the location and scale
parameters. Realizations of this bounded distribution are derived
from the transformation

   U = a + 0.5*(b-a)*[ 1 + tanh((m + s*G)/2*pi) ]		(1)

where G is a Gaussian random field with mean zero and unit variance,
(a,b) are the lower and upper bounds of the distribution, and (m,s)
are the distribution parameters controlling its shape. When m = 0,
the distribution is symmetric about the midpoint, 0.5*(a + b), with
smaller values of s yielding a narrower unimodal peak. Note that using
m = 0 implies that the mean value is centered on the range. Other
values of m have not been investigated. See also Fenton, G.A.,
Simulation and Analysis of Random Fields, Ph.D. Thesis, Princeton
University, 1990, pg 139, and Spatial Variation in Liquefaction
Risk, Geotechnique, Vol 48(6), 1998, pgs 821 and 822 for further
details on this bounded distribution. The Local Average Subdivision
(LAS) algorithm used to generate sample fields in this program replaces
the G field in Eq.(1) with the local average of G, G_e, over the
element domains (and so the variance of G_e will be less than or equal
to unity, depending on the correlation length and the element size).

The friction angle, phi, is often represented by the bounded
distribution, since it is bounded both below and above (eg, by 0 and 90
degrees). However, it is often desirable to deal with tan(phi), rather
than phi, so the option is given here to specify the distribution
of tan(phi) rather than phi directly. If the distribution on tan(phi)
is specified, then tan(phi) becomes the simulated random field. Since
tan(phi) varies from 0 to infinity as phi varies from 0 to 90 degrees,
a reasonable distribution on tan(phi) is the lognormal.

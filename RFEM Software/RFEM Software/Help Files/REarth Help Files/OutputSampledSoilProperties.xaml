        The `output sampled soil properties' flag, when set to true, results in the
(average) sampled friction angle, unit weight, and cohesion values being
written to the output file *.sam for each realization. These are the values
which were used in the Rankine prediction of the wall reaction and overturning
moment.  Outputting these (average) sampled values is sometimes useful if the
distribution of the sampled soil values is to be checked or if individual
values are of interest.

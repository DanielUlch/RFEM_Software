    <Paragraph>
        The wall, which extends nwe elements down the left hand side, is rigid
and is translated horizontally into (passive) or away from (active) the
soil mass.

On this line, the number of elements in the x and y directions, nxe
and nye, respectively, are specified.

The following finite element features also apply;

      - the right boundary is fixed in the x-direction and therefore
        only allow movement in the (vertical) y-direction.
      - the bottom boundary is completely fixed and therefore there is no
        movement allowed along this boundary.
      - the top boundary is the ground level and is free to deform under the
        application of the wall displacement.

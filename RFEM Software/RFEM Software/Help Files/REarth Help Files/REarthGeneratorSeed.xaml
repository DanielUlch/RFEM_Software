    <Paragraph>
        Realizations of the random soil property fields are generated using a random
number generator. The random number generator is initialized by a positive
integer, or `seed'. If the same seed is used on subsequent runs, the same
sequence of random numbers is generated (which is sometimes useful to compare
changes in design parameters). The initial seed to use is specified on this
line. If 0 is specified, a seed is generated internally using the system
time or process ID, depending on the operating system. In the case where the
seed is specified here as 0, the *.stt output file should be consulted to see
what seed was actually used. The initial seed is also reported in the
Results->Summary page.

The second realization uses a seed which is equal to the initial seed plus
one. The third realization uses the initial seed plus two, and so on. This
means that if it is desired to reproduce the results of the 354'th run, for
example, a single realization can be run using a seed equal to the initial
seed plus 353.

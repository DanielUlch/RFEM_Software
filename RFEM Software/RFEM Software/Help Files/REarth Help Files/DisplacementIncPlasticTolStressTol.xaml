        The program computes the plane strain deformation and resulting stresses
of an elastic-plastic Von-Mises solid (ie the soil) using 8-node
quadrilateral elements via the viscoplastic strain method. The soil
mass is restrained by a wall on the left face which is either moved
into (passive) or away (active) from the soil. Statistics of the
resultant total soil reaction are computed by Monte Carlo simulation.
The soil model appears as follows;

        The wall, which extends nwe elements down the left hand side, is rigid
and is translated horizontally into (passive) or away from (active) the
soil mass. It may be either `smooth' or `rough', allowing or not allowing
the soil to slide along its surface, respectively. NOTE: to allow the
formation of a proper failure mechanism, the wall should not extend to
the bottom of the soil mass. That is, nwe should not exceed about
(nye - 5).

The horizontal load exerted on the wall by the soil is determined by
gradually displacing the wall into (passive) or away (active) from the
soil mass. In either case, the load is deemed to have achieved its
final value when the soil is in a state of plastic failure. To determine
this, three parameters are needed, as specified on this line;

   1) the horizontal displacement increment: The wall reaction analysis
      involves a displacement controlled loading, and displacement is
      incremented in a series (see next) of displacement steps each of
      size equal to the prescribed value. Positive displacement increments
      results in displacement into the soil mass (passive loading). Note
      that because passive loading generally takes a greater displacement
      to achieve plastic failure than does active loading, it is normal to
      make the displacement increment in the passive case larger than that
      in the active case. The size of the increment is normally determined
      by trial and error, perhaps by running the deterministic analysis
      (all soil properties spatially constant) and aiming for a
      displacement increment which gives about 10 displacement steps until
      soil failure. The number of displacement steps taken in the
      deterministic case is reported to the output *.stt file (see
      Summary, after running the program).

   2) The convergence tolerance for the plasticity algorithm: When the nodal
      displacement state from one iteration to the next has a relative
      change (max-norm) of less than this convergence tolerance the soil
      is assumed to have achieved plastic equilibrium and iterations are
      halted.

   3) The convergence tolerance on the computed wall reaction: When the
      stress state from one increment to the next has a relative change
      (max-norm) of less than this tolerance the soil failure load is
      assumed to have been reached and the displacement steps are
      discontinued.

    <Paragraph>
        This entry is for the sample locations, specified as (x,y)
indices into the random field arrays. These arrays are indexed
as follows; (1,1) is at the upper left corner of the field,
(1,2) is just below (1,1), while (2,1) is just to the right
of element (1,1), etc. That is, elements are counted down and
then to the right. One (x,y) index pair is to be provided for
each sample to specify its location.

For example, if two soil samples are taken, and this entry
contains the following;

	12 8  12 18

then this means that the two soil samples are taken at the
(x,y) indices (12,8) and (12,18). (It is assumed that the
provided indices actually fall within the soil mass -- a
warning is issued if this is not the case.)

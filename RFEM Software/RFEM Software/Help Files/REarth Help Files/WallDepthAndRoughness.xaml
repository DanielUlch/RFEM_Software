        The program computes the plane strain deformation and resulting stresses
of an elastic-plastic Von-Mises solid (ie the soil) using 8-node
quadrilateral elements via the viscoplastic strain method. The soil
mass is restrained by a wall on the left face which is either moved
into (passive) or away (active) from the soil. Statistics of the
resultant total soil reaction are computed by Monte Carlo simulation.
The soil model appears as follows;

        The wall, which extends nwe elements down the left hand side, is rigid
and is translated horizontally into (passive) or away from (active) the
soil mass. It may be either `smooth' or `rough', allowing or not allowing
the soil to slide along its surface, respectively. NOTE: to allow the
formation of a proper failure mechanism, the wall should not extend to
the bottom of the soil mass. That is, nwe should not exceed about
(nye - 5).

On this line, the number of elements that the wall extends down the
left hand face, nwe, is specified. In addition, the interface between
the wall may be selected is being either rough, a no-slip condition, or
smooth, where the soil is allowed to slide across the wall.

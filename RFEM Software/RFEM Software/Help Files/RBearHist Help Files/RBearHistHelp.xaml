        hist_bear2d(1)

NAME
  hist_bear2d - reads sample output files produced by RBEAR2D and plots a
                histogram of the realizations.

SYNOPSIS
  hist_bear2d [options] file1 [file2 ...]

DESCRIPTION
  This program reads a sequence of input files, assumed to be composed of
  individual realizations of various output quantities produced by RBEAR2D and
  plots the data as a histogram, optionally superimposed by a plot of a fitted
  distribution. In the latter case, the option is provided to compute the
  critical p-value of the Chi-Square goodness-of-fit test. This value is
  placed in the line key for fitted distribution. The Anderson-Darling
  goodness-of-fit statistic is also printed to standard output.

  The output plot file is in PLOTPS format and is called `hist.plotps' (any
  existing files of this name will be overwritten).

  The input files are assumed to consist of the following data;

    1) source name			(string)
    2) job title			(string)
    3) subtitle 1			(string)
    4) subtitle 2			(string)
    5) `?? system parameters to follow:' (?? = no. of strings to follow)
	a) sequence of strings containing system parameters
	b) .
	.
	.
	??)
    6) blank line
    7) `?? columns of data:' (?? = no. of columns of data)
	a) description for data column #1
	b) description for data column #2
	.
	.
	??) description for data column #??
    8) ?? columns of data, all of equal length

  Each line in the ?? columns of data corresponds to one realization and
  the total number of lines is the total number of realizations, nsim.
  This program can plot from one to 4 columns of data at once (see -p option)
  on the same plot. Each input file will produce a separate plot on the
  current page.

OPTIONS
  All of the following options must appear separately before any data
  file names. Square brackets denote optional quantities - if the optional
  quantity is provided, do not include the brackets (for example, -d1 would
  imply that a lognormal distribution is to be fitted to the data).

    -A      include the Anderson-Darling (AD) goodness-of-fit statistic
            in the line key for a fitted distribution along with the
            distribution parameters. This option is only effective in
            conjunction with the -d option.

    -a      plot a histogram of the absolute values of the data. This
            is generally not very useful, since bearing capacity should
            always be positive anyhow.

    -b??    used to prescribed the number of buckets to be used for the
            histograms (default is 50, maximum is 200).

    -c      include the critical p-value in the line key for a fitted
            distribution along with the distribution parameters. This
            option is only effective in conjunction with the -d option.

    -d[?]   fit a distribution to the data. The distribution type is
            determined by the optional digit following the d according
            to
		? = 0 to fit a normal distribution to the data
		? = 1 to fit a lognormal distribution to the data (default)
		? = 2 to fit an exponential distribution to the data
		? = 3 to fit a Beta distribution to the data
		? = 4 to fit a Gamma distribution to the data
		? = 5 to fit a uniform distribution to the data

    -D      provide debugging output

    -e??,??,??,??
            specify the x axis length (inches), the y axis length (inches),
            the x origin offset (inches from the left edge of the page),
            and the y origin offset (inches from the bottom of the page).
            All four values must be provided, and commas must separate
            the values (no whitespace). If more than one plot is being
            produced, the axis lengths and x origin offset will be the
            same for all. The y origin offset is viewed as being that of
            the uppermost (first) plot; subsequent plots are shifted down by
            the y axis length plus 0.75 inches.

    -E??    estimate the probability that the bearing capacity of the first
            specified footing (first column of *.cap) exceeds the value given
            by ??. For example -E0.04 would estimate the probability that
            the bearing capacity of the first specified footing
            exceeds 0.04 (number exceeding/total number of realizations).

    -k??,??
            specify the offset to the top left corner of the line key in
            inches from the plot origin (xkey,ykey).

    -K      do not show the line key.

    -L      use a logarithmically scaled x axis. Note that in this case,
            the values of x must all be positive.

    -o??    prescribe an alternative offset to the plot titles (default is
            0.0 inches).

    -p?[,?[,?[,?]]]
            specify the quantity(s) that you wish to plot. If this option is
	     absent, then the first column of data in each input file is
	     plotted. The ? character(s) are replaced by numbers denoting the
            column of data to be plotted. For example, -p3,4 implies that
            the 3rd and 4th columns of data are to be plotted. They will
            appear as two lines in the plot. Up to 4 columns of data can
            be plotted simultaneously. A warning is issued if you try to
            plot a column which does not exist.

    -q      run quietly. Don't write anything other than error messages to
            standard output.

    -s?     scale factor. This option causes the input data to be scaled by
            the factor `?'. This is most often used if the histogram is to
            be of the data normalized by the mean. For example, if a histogram
            of the M_c bearing capacity factor (where M_c = bearing cap/mu_c)
            is to be plotted, then `?' should be set equal to 1/mu_c. The
            scale factor does not affect the -E option (that is, the threshold
            provide by the -E option must be relative to the actual data).

    -T      do not print plot titles.

    -x??,??,??
            used to specify the minimum, maximum, and increment on the x axis
            The same values are used for all input files.

    -y??,??,??
            used to specify the minimum, maximum, and increment on the y axis
            The same values are used for all input files.

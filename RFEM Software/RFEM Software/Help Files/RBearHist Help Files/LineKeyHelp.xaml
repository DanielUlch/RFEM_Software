        This option enables displaying a line key, which is only appropriate
if more than one line is to be displayed (eg, the histogram and the
fitted distribution). The line key consists of a line segment, of
the same type as the corresponding plot curve, followed by a
description. For example, if the plot has both a solid line and a
dashed line, then the line key would contain a solid line segment
followed by the description of that line and then below this a
dashed line segment followed by the description of that line.
For example

   ----------------------------------------------> x axis

The line key position is specified by two offsets (see above);

1) X-offset: this is the distance, in inches, between the y-axis
             and the left-most edge of the line key
2) Y-offset: this is the distance, in inches, from the x-axis to
             the top of the line key.

If these two offsets are left as zero, reasonable values are
estimated internally.

        If enabled this option causes a distribution to be fitted to the
histogram. The user must select from one of the provided
distribution types, in which case the parameters (mean, variance,
bounds, etc) of the fitted distribution are estimated from the
simulation results and the fitted distribution shown as a second
plot over the histogram. The fitted distribution parameters are
shown in the line key (if enabled).

The most commonly selected distribution type is lognormal since
this is a strictly non-negative distribution. For example, the
lognormal distribution is at least physically reasonable for
bearing capacity since bearing capacity is non-negative for all
downwards directed loads. For such non-negative quantities, the
normal distribution may be a viable alternative (and popular, due
to its simplicity) if the coefficient of variation is reasonably
small (less than about 0.3) where the probability of negative
outcomes is reasonably small.

        A histogram counts number of outcomes from the simulation that fall
into each of a series of intervals and then plots these frequency
counts as a series of bars. This then is a graphical representation
of the relative likelihood that the simulation outcomes will fall
into each interval.

Choosing the best number of intervals to use in the representation
is an art. Too many and the histogram tends to appear as a lot of
of small bumps along the horizontal axis. Too few, and the shape of
the distribution cannot be seen. A rough rule of thumb is to use
about 5% to 10% of the number of realizations used in the
simulation, but generally at least about 10.

Notes:
   1) the histogram is plotted as a `frequency-density' plot, having
      unit area.
   2) the histogram appears as a bar plot unless a distribution is
      also fitted, in which case the histogram is shown using straight
      lines between the frequency counts.

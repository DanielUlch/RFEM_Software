        This option allows the x-axis details to be specified. Basically
an axis has several attributes. The length and position attributes
are specified above (see `Set lengths and origin of plot axes').
There are three other attributes;
1) the minimum value to appear on the axis. This is the value used
   to label the first tick mark on the axis, at the origin.
2) the maximum value to appear on the axis. This is the value used
   to label the last tick mark on the axis.
3) the tick mark increment. Successive tick marks will be labeled
   at this increment.

So, for example if the minimum, maximum, and increment are set to
1.5, 3.5, 0.5, respectively, then the axis labels will be

	1.5  2.0  2.5  3.0  3.5

The program reasonably well handles cases where the increment does
not evenly divide the range between the minimum and the maximum, and
cases where the labeling decreases (min > max, and increment is
negative).

Reasonable default values are computed internally from the data, so
if in doubt turn this option off.

NOTE: if the axis is logarithmically scaled (see `Use logarithmically
      scaled x-axis' option above), the `increment' is treated as the
      ratio of (larger over smaller) adjacent tick mark values. This
      would normally be 10.0, to get the tick mark values to change
      by a factor of 10.

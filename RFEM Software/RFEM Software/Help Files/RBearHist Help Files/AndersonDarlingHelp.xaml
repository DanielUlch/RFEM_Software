        If this option is enabled, an Anderson-Darling goodness-of-fit test
is performed to test to see if the fitted distribution is unacceptable.
The test's null hypothesis is that the simulation data follows the
prescribed distribution. The test result (rejected or not) is reported
in the plot's line key (so the line key, below, should be enabled).

At this time, Anderson-Darling critical test values are only known for
a few distributions and so the test is only applied in this program to
the normal, lognormal, and exponential distributions (this flag is
otherwise ignored). The Anderson-Darling test is generally considered
to be one of the more powerful statistical tests. The Chi-Square
goodness-of-fit test may also be useful as an alternative test which
has the advantage of yielding a p-value and which can be used for any
distribution.

Note that statistical rejection and `reasonableness' of the
distribution are two different things. Statistical rejection
basically means that the data says that the distribution is not
EXACTLY as specified (eg, lognormal with parameters mu_lnx and
sigma_lnx). It is at least SLIGHTLY different (for example mu_lnx
is not 3.46, but is actually 3.47, etc). But this does not mean
that the selected distribution is not REASONABLE. If the goodness-
of-fit test results in the rejection of the null hypothesis that
the distribution is as selected above, you should still have a
look at the fit between the histogram and the fitted distribution.
It may very well be a reasonable fit.

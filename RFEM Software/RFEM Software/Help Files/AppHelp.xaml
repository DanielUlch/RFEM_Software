In 1992 Drs. G.A. Fenton and D.V. Griffiths combined random field simulation
with the finite element method to produce the Random Finite Element Method, or
RFEM. The method has been used to investigate the random behaviour of soils in
the context of a variety of classical geotechnical problems, ranging from
settlement of shallow foundations to the collapse of rock pillars. All but the
most recent publications arising out of this research can be found at
http://www.engmath.dal.ca/rfem/rfem_pubs.html.  (For the most recent
publications, you will have to obtain the journal versions.)

The authors are making all of their RFEM software freely available, along with
the finite element libraries written by I.M. Smith and D.V. Griffiths (which
have been public for many years) and the simulation and numerical library
written by G.A. Fenton.

The RFEM front end executables (under Windows) include the following;

	mrbear2d:  2-D shallow foundation stochastic bearing capacity analysis,

	mrdam2d:   2-D stochastic earth dam analysis,

	mrearth2d: 2-D stochastic earth pressure analysis,

	mrflow2d:  2-D stochastic seepage analysis,

	mrflow3d:  3-D stochastic seepage analysis,

	mrpill2d:  2-D stochastic pillar analysis,

	mrpill3d:  3-D stochastic pillar analysis,

	mrsetl2d:  2-D shallow foundation stochastic settlement analysis,

	mrsetl3d:  3-D shallow foundation stochastic settlement analysis,

	mrslope2d: 2-D stochastic slope stability analysis,

In order to look at some of the output of these programs, you will need to
install a Postscript viewer. See http://www.engmath.dal.ca/ghostscript for the
required software packages. You need to install ghostscript first, then
ghostview (the 64bit version of both is for x86_64 computers).  Remember what
folder you install the viewer into -- you will need to know the directory
(folder) and the executable name in order to get the RFEM programs to view
graphical results. Use Windows Explorer to find the executable, which is
(probably) called gsview32.exe or gsview64.exe. This information is placed
in the rfem.inf file, discussed shortly.

The complete current version of the RFEM distribution for the Windows
environment is at http://www.engmath.dal.ca/rfem/RFEM_Windows_1.1.1.exe

The easiest way to install the RFEM distribution is to extract it into the c:\
directory. This will create a subdirectory called c:\rfem within which all of
the executables, libraries, and source code resides.

After extracting the distribution, you will need to perform the
following steps;

     1)	edit the file rfem\rfem.inf using an ordinary editor (e.g. Notepad,
	not MS Word).

     2)	set BINDIR to the path to the rfem\bin folder (c:\rfem\bin by
	default),

     3)	set HELPDIR to the path to the rfem\lib\help folder (c:\rfem\lib\help
	by default),

     4)	set GHOSTVIEW to the path and executable name of a Postscript
	viewing program (see discussion about GSView above),

     5)	move or copy the rfem.inf file into the directory c:\windows\inf.

To uninstall the distribution simply remove the rfem directory and the
c:\windows\inf\rfem.inf file (if you copied the latter over).

Now, if you look in the rfem\bin directory, you should be able to run any
of the programs listed above, e.g. mrsetl2d.exe. Some hints at running
these programs;

     -	to get the output to appear in a specific folder, simply set the
	basename to include the folder path, e.g. d:\gordon\temp\rsetl2d
     -	virtually all of the entries have a little button beside it labeled
	"Help". If in doubt, click on it.
     -	the non-linear programs (mrbear2d, mrslope2d, mrpill?d, mrearth2d)
	may take a LONG time to run. You may want to test it using just
	a few realizations to get a sense for timing prior to cranking
	the final run(s).
     -	the leading "m" in these programs stands for "graphical front
	end" (in whatever language "graphical front end" starts with
	the letter "m"! Actually, it was sort of a mistake -- I usually
	name just the main routine of a program with a leading "m", and
	my early attempts at Borland C++ Builder named the executable the
	same name as the main...). Anyhow, what this means is that when
	you "run" mrbear2d, for example, by clicking on the little black
	triangle, it actually executes another program named "rbear2d"
	which reads the data file you have just created and runs the
	RFEM simulations. "rbear2d.exe" is in the rfem\bin directory. The
	source code for rbear2d.exe is in rfem\sim\rbear2d. The source
	code for mrbear2d.exe is in rfem\sim\rbear2d\gui.

Also included in this distribution are the following;

     1)	DVGlib: double precision finite element
	library, written by I.M. Smith and D.V. Griffiths.

     2)	VGlib: single precision finite element
	library, written by I.M. Smith and D.V. Griffiths. The
	compiled version of this library is in rfem\lib\vfem.lib. This
	library is needed to recompile any of the r-progs, e.g. rbear2d.

     3)	doc: documentation for; the r-progs, a
	series of r-prog utilities (e.g. hist_* are programs designed to
	create histograms of the output samples from the r-progs), plotps,
	display, and a bunch of other things which you should be able to find
	somewhere in this distribution.

     4)	gaf77: simulation routines (e.g. LAS) written
	by Gordon A. Fenton. This library includes LOTS of other things --
	a complete list of the routines can be found in rfem\gaf77\Summary.doc,
	which is an ordinary text file, NOT an MS Word document. Each routine
	has a lengthy commentary at its start explaining the routine in
	detail. The compiled library is in rfem\lib\gaf77.lib. It is needed
	if you want to recompile virtually all of the programs in this
	distribution (NOTE: to recompile a particular program, you will need
	to edit its "Makefile" to tell it where the library is prior to
	running "make").

     5)	graphics: this folder actually includes three
	subfolders:

	     a)	pslib: a postscript plotting library
		written by Gordon A. Fenton. See the files PSLIB.3f (text),
		PSLIB.ps (postscript), or Summary.doc (text) in
		rfem\graphics\pslib for more details.

	     b)	plotps: a program which produces x-y
		type plots in postscript, written by Gordon A. Fenton.
		See rfem\doc\plotps.txt for more details.

	     c)	display: a program which produces plots
		of 3-D data in postscript, written by Gordon A. Fenton.
		See rfem\doc\display.txt for more details.

     6)	lib: where the compiled libraries and help
	files are stored.

     7)	sim: includes a series of sub-folders which contain the source code
	for various programs. The following are the r-progs written by
	Gordon A. Fenton and D.V. Griffiths;

	     a)	rbear2d: 2-D shallow foundation stochastic bearing capacity
			analysis,
	     b)	rdam2d: 2-D stochastic earth dam analysis,
	     c)	rearth2d: 2-D stochastic earth pressure analysis,
	     d)	rflow2d: 2-D stochastic seepage analysis,
	     e)	rflow3d: 3-D stochastic seepage analysis,
	     f)	rpill2d: 2-D stochastic pillar analysis,
	     g)	rpill3d: 3-D stochastic pillar analysis,
	     h)	rsetl2d: 2-D shallow foundation stochastic settlement analysis,
	     i)	rsetl3d: 3-D shallow foundation stochastic settlement analysis,
	     j)	rslope2d: 2-D stochastic slope stability analysis,
	     k)	rpile1d: 1-D deep foundation stochastic analysis.
		The last is a recent addition, with no corresponding graphical
		front-end at this time.

	In addition, the following codes are provided;

	     l)	rfest1d: a suite of programs developed by Gordon A. Fenton
		at the Norwegian Geotechnical Institute to statistically
		analyze CPT soundings.
	     m)	simqke2: a program developed by Gordon A. Fenton, Erik H.
		Vanmarcke, and Ernesto Heredia to simulate spatially
		correlated and optionally conditioned earthquake ground
		motions.
	     n)	test routines: a set of folders (test* and tst*) containing
		programs designed to run the various random field generators.
		They are primarily included here for those of you interested
		in writing your own simulation programs -- these can be used
		as templates.
	     o)	utils: a series of programs to compute things such as local
		average variances, generate random variables, and compute
		normal distribution probabilities. See the Makefile for a
		brief descriptions of each program.


     8)	utils: this folder includes several subfolders:

	     a)	cor2d: a program which estimates a
		2-D correlation structure, written by Gordon A. Fenton. See
		cor2d.1 (text) for details.

	     b)	krige: a program which computes
		best linear unbiased estimates (kriging), written by
		Gordon A. Fenton. See krige.1 (text) for details.

	     c)	mkhst: a program which plots a

		matrix operations (e.g. multiplication, Cholesky decomposition,
		LU decomposition, solution to linear system, matrix inverse,
		condition number, singular-value-decomposition). Written by

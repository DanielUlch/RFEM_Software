NAME
  rbear2d - computes bearing capacity statistics in a soil with spatially
            random properties

SYNOPSIS
  rbear2d datafile

DESCRIPTION
  This program performs a bearing capacity stochastic analysis of a soil
  mass. In particular, it computes the plane strain deformation of an
  elastic-plastic Von-Mises solid using 8-node quadrilateral elements
  via the viscoplastic strain method.

  The data file is assumed to have the following format (see rbear2d.1 
for
  detailed information). Optional quantities are shown in square 
brackets;
  if absent, reasonable defaults are provided, as shown in the following
  example data file. If a value is provided, do NOT include the brackets.

  where each line starts in the 1st column and each input data value
  starts in the 50th column (ie, the first 49 characters are ignored).
  Input is free format.

  Detailed comments on the data file are as follows;

    1)	the job title is a character string which is simply
	echoed to various output files.
    2)	the `echo input data' flag, when set to true, results in the
	input data being echoed to the output *.stt file.
    3)	the `report progess' flag, when set to true, reports which 
realization
	is being currently processed to standard output.
    4)	the `dump debug data' flag, when set to true, results in 
detailed
	information being dumped to the *.stt file as the run proceeds.
	This flag should probably only be used with small runs (nsim 
small).
    5)	the `display random field' flag, when set to true, produces a
	DISPLAY format output file of the grey-scaled random field to 
*.fld.
	The flag is optionally followed by up to two quantities;
	 i) the realization number to be plotted, defaulting to the first,
	ii) a character string denoting the type of field to display. This
	    string can be one of
		`c'   (cohesion),
		`phi' (friction angle),
		`psi' (dilation angle),
		`e'   (elastic modulus), or
		`v'   (Poisson's ratio)',
	    defaulting to the cohesion field.
    6)	the `display displaced finite element mesh' flag, when set to 
true,
	produces a PostScript output file of the finite element mesh after
	bearing failure to *.dis. The flag is optionally followed by the
	realization number to be plotted. If absent, the first random field
	is plotted. A number of additional plotting options are provided 
for
	at the end of the data file.
    7)	the `normalize bearing capacities' flag, when set to true, 
causes
	the individual bearing capacity realizations to be divided by the
	deterministic (at the mean) bearing capacity. The resulting 
normalized
	bearing capacity statistics thus tend to be centered around 1.0,
	although the mean may not be 1.0.
    8)	the `output bearing nodal reaction samples' flag, when set to 
true,
	results in the output of a sequence of (nsim) bearing capacity
	(in the form of maximum nodal reactions) realizations to output
	file *.cap.
    9)	on this line the number of elements in the x (horizontal) and
	y (vertical) directions are input. All elements are assumed to
	have the same size and aspect ratio. 
   10)	on this line the element size, in the x (horizontal) and y
	(vertical) directions are input. The `sizes' are the physical
	dimensions of the elements, in units consistent with, for example,
	the scale of fluctuation.
   11)	on this line, three integers, referred to here as `nfound', 
`nfoot',
	and `ngap' are defined.
	  i) `nfound' denotes the number of footings applied to the soil 
mass.
	     It can take values 1 or 2. If nfound = 1, then the value of
	     ngap is ignored.
	 ii) `nfoot' gives the number of elements, in the x-direction, 
underc
	     the footing. If there are two footings, each is assumed to 
have
	     width nfoot elements (and thus physical width of a footing is
	     equal to nfoot*dx).
	iii) `ngap' gives the number of elements, in the x-direction, 
between
	     the two footings when nfound = 2. If nfound = 1, this 
parameter
	     is ignored.
   12)	on this line, three real values are defined;
	  i) `presc' is the vertical displacement increment. The bearing
	     capacity analysis involves a displacement controlled loading,
	     and displacement is incremented in maxst (see next) downward
	     displacement steps each of size equal to presc. Ideally, presc
	     should be selected so that bearing capacity is achieved in
	     about 10 displacement steps -- too much less and the bearing
	     capacity accuracy degrades, too much more and too much time
	     is wasted getting to the bearing capacity. The output *.stt
	     file can be consulted to see how many displacement steps were
	     required in the deterministic case, and this can be used to
	     estimate presc, sometimes through trial and error.
	 ii) `tolp' is the convergence tolerance in the plasticity
	     algorithm. When the nodal displacement state from one 
iteration
	     to the next has a relative change (max-norm) of less than tolp
	     the iterations are halted.
	iii) `tolb' is the convergence tolerance on the computed bearing
	     capacity. When the bearing stress under the footing(s) from
	     one increment to the next has a relative change (max-norm) of
	     less than tolb, or is starting to decrease, bearing capacity
	     is assumed reached, and the displacement steps are 
discontinued. 
   13)	on this line, two integers are defined;
	  i) `maxst' is the ceiling on the number of displacement 
increments
	     allowed to be carried out. This is to prevent a runaway 
analysis.
	 ii) `maxit' is the ceiling on the number of iterations allowed for
	     each displacement increment.
   14)	this line contains the soil cohesion mean, standard 
deviation, and
	distribution type. The last is one of
		`d[eterministic], `n[ormal]', `l[ognormal]', or `b[ounded]'
	(actually only the minimal identifying character string needs to be
	input, ie, `d', `n', `l', or `b'. Thus, the letters
	within the [...] are optional and are provided only for clarity).
	The distribution type is followed by the distribution parameters,
	p(4), p(5), p(6), and p(7) (where `p' is replaced by the soil
	property variable name -- see above), if the distribution type 
needs
	more parameters than the mean and standard deviation.
	The `deterministic' distribution type needs only the mean, although
	the standard deviation parameter must be present (set it to zero 
for
	consistency - it is, however, ignored anyhow).
	The normal and lognormal distributions require only the mean and
	standard deviation as parameters.
	The bounded distribution requires additional parameters, namely the
	lower and upper bounds on the distribution and the location and 
scale
	parameters. In the bounded case, the provided mean and standard
	deviation are ignored, the distribution shape and range being 
entirely
	dictated by its four parameters (p(4),p(5),p(6),p(7)) = (a,b,m,s).
	The bounded distribution is derived from the transformation

	   U = a + 0.5*(b-a)*[ 1 + tanh((m + s*Y)/2*pi) ]

	where Y is a Gaussian random field with mean zero and unit 
variance,
	(a,b) are the lower and upper bounds of the distribution, and (m,s)
	are the distribution parameters controlling its shape. When m = 0,
	the distribution is symmetric about the midpoint, 0.5*(a + b), with
	smaller values of s yielding a narrower unimodal peak. Note that 
using
	m = 0 implies that the mean value is centered on the range. Other
	values of m have not been investigated. See also Fenton, G.A.,
	Simulation and Analysis of Random Fields, Ph.D. Thesis, Princeton
	University, 1990, pg 139, and Spatial Variation in Liquefaction
	Risk, Geotechnique, Vol 48(6), 1998, pgs 821 and 822 for further
	details on this bounded distribution.
   15)	this line contains the soil friction angle mean, standard 
deviation
	and distribution type. See above for details on the distribution
	type. An exception is that if the distribution type is prefixed
	by the letter `t', then the random variable is assumed to be
	tan(phi), rather than phi itself. For example, the input line

	Friction ang tan(phi) mean, SD, and dist . . . . 0.36   0.2 tl

	implies that tan(phi) has mean 0.36, standard deviation 0.2 and
	is lognormally distributed.
   16)	this line contains the soil dilation angle (in degrees) mean,
	standard deviation, and distribution type. See line 14 for details
	on the distribution type.
   17)	this line contains the soil elastic modulus mean, standard 
deviation,
	and distribution type. See line 14 for details on the distribution
	type.
   18)	this line contains the soil Poisson ratio mean, standard 
deviation,
	and distribution type. See line 14 for details on the distribution
	type.
   19)	this is the number of realizations to perform. As the number 
of
	realizations increases, the `accuracy' of estimated output 
statistics
	also increases. To accurately estimate the probability of some very
	unlikely outcomes of interest, a very large number of realizations
	may be required. In most cases, the standard deviation of any
	estimate of probability obtained from nsim realizations is
	just that for the Bernoulli random variable: sqrt(p*q/nsim), where
	p = estimated probability, and q = 1-p. A rough guideline is to
	use nsim > (4*p*q)/(e*e) for target probability, p, and error
	tolerance on p of size `e'. (For example, if p = 0.001, and e = 
0.0001,
	then nsim > (4*0.001*0.999)/(0.0001*0.0001) = about 400,000
	realizations. Such a large number of realizations, however, may
	be prohibitive even with modern fast computers.)
   20)	this is a non-negative integer generator seed. If this number 
is 0,
	then a generator seed is produced internally using either the 
process
	PID or the clock time (depending on the machine operating system 
and
	how this program was compiled). Otherwise, the pseudo-random number
	generator is initialized with the provided whole number.
   21)	here the x- and y-direction scales of fluctuation are input. 
The
	`scale of fluctuation' is, loosely speaking, the distance within
	which the material properties are significantly correlated. For
	example, if the x-direction scale of fluctuation is 2.0 metres, 
then
	the elastic modulus at x = 0.0 metres is reasonably well correlated
	to the elastic modulus at x = 0.8 metres, but negligibly correlated 
to
	elastic modulus at x = 4.0 metres. The actual definition of the
	scale of fluctuation is more involved. See Vanmarcke, `Random
	Fields: Analysis and Synthesis', MIT Press, 1984, for more details.
	Note that in the case of the lognormal or bounded distributions,
	the parameter provided here refers to the transformed random 
fields.
	For example, if elastic modulus is lognormally distributed, then
	the scales given here are the scales of log-elastic modulus field
	(estimated directly from the logarithm of the data). Similarly, if
	the elastic modulus, E, is bounded with parameters (a,b,m=0,s), 
then
	the scales are estimated from the

	   pi*ln[(E-a)/(b-E)]

	transformed data. The parameter `s' may also be estimated from this
	transformed data using an estimate of its standard deviation.
	NOTE: the `scales of fluctuation' are, more specifically, used here
	to contain the primary parameters of the variance functions listed
	below.
   22)	on this line the name of the variance/covariance function
	corresponding to the random field is input. Possible variance/covar
	function names are as follows;
		`dlavx2' - 2-D exponentially decaying (Markov) model
			   requires X- and Y-direction scales of fluctuation
		`dlafr2' - 2-D isotropic fractional Gaussian noise model
			   requires (H,delta) as parameters. In this case,
			   thx is H, and delta is the minimum element
			   dimension.
		`dlsep2' - 2-D separable (1D x 1D) Markov model
			   requires X- and Y-direction scales of fluctuation
		`dlsfr2' - 2-D separable fractional Gaussian noise model
			   requires (H_x,H_y,delta) as parameters. In this
			   case, thx is H_x, thy is H_y, and delta is the
			   minimum element dimension.
		`dlspx2' - 2-D separable Gaussian decaying model
			   requires X- and Y-direction scales of fluctuation
 23-27) these are simply title lines and are ignored by the program 
(although
	they MUST be present.
   28)	on this, and on as many more lines as necessary, the 
correlation
	coefficient acting (on a point-wise basis) between the random 
material
	properties is input. In the example file shown above, we are saying
	that the correlation coefficient between the cohesion and the 
friction
	angle is 0.2, between the dilation angle and elastic modulus is 
0.4,
	etc. Only non-zero correlations need to be mentioned in the table, 
all
	others are assumed to be uncorrelated.
	NOTE: the correlations are assumed to apply to the transformed
	variates. For example, if c is assumed normally distributed and
	phi is assumed to be lognormally distributed, then the correlation
	coefficient is assumed to be 0.2 between c and log(phi).
   29)	this blank line denotes the end of the correlation matrix 
data and
	must be present even if there is no non-zero correlation (in which
	case only the blank line will be present).
   30)	the `show element boundaries' flag, when set to true, results 
in
	elements being drawn onto the displaced mesh plot, *.dis, outlined
	with black lines.
   31)	the `show random field' flag, when set to true, results in 
the random
 	field being displayed as a greyscale background to the displaced 
mesh
 	plot, *.dis. Low values are light and high values are dark.
	This flag may be optionally followed by a logical flag
 	which is true if the log(random field) is to be displayed (default 
is
 	false). In turn, this flag may be optionally followed by a 
character
 	string, one of `c', `phi', `psi', `e', or `v' denoting the actual
 	random field to display. The default is the cohesion field (c).
   32)	this line contains a positive real number giving the desired
	width of the displaced mesh plot, in inches. This refers 
specifically
	to the width of the soil mass itself -- any labels, arrows, titles, 
etc
	will appear outside the soil mass. The height of the soil mass
	is computed internally so that the finite element model aspect
	ratio is preserved. This number may be optionally followed by
	another real number specifying the height, in inches, of the soil
	domain (if the default aspect ratio is not to be preserved).
   33)	this line contains two real numbers giving the offset, in the 
X-
	and Y-directions, respectively, from the lower left corner of the
	paper to the lower left corner of the soil mass as measured on the
	printed page. If the second value is missing, it is assumed equal
	to the first.

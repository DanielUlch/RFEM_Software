        The `normalize bearing capacities' flag, when checked, causes
the individual bearing capacity realizations to be divided by the
deterministic (at the mean) bearing capacity. The resulting normalized
bearing capacity statistics thus tend to be centered around 1.0,
although the mean may not be 1.0. This is mainly useful to give a sense
of relative capacity variabilty and the coefficient of variation.

        The `output bearing capacity samples' flag, when checked,
results in the output of a sequence of (nsim) computed bearing
capacity realizations to the output file *.cap. This is usually
worth doing, since the output file can then be postprocessed to
estimate distributions and probabilities associated with bearing
capacity. See the Results menu after the program has completed.

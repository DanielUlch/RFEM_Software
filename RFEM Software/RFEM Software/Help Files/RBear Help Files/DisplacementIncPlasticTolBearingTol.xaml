    <Paragraph>
        The bearing capacity of the soil underlying the footing is computed by
gradually displacing the footing into the soil until the soil reaction
fails to increase by more than a small relative tolerance (bearing
tolerance). On this line, three quantities are specified;

   1) the vertical displacement increment: This is the distance (in length
      units consistent with the rest of the data, normally metres) that
      the footing is displaced on each `displacement step'. The displacement
      increment should be small, to avoid missing the true bearing capacity,
      but not too small, to avoid having an excessive number of displacement
      increments before the bearing capacity is reached. The size of the
      increment is normally determined by trial and error, perhaps by
      running the deterministic analysis (all soil properties spatially
      constant) and aiming for a displacement increment which gives about
      10 displacement steps until failure. The number of displacement steps
      taken in the deterministic case is reported to the output *.stt file
      (see Summary, after running the program).

   2) The convergence tolerance for the plasticity algorithm: When the nodal
      displacement state from one iteration to the next has a relative
      change (max-norm) of less than this convergence tolerance the soil
      is assumed to have achieved equilibrium and iterations are halted.

   3) The convergence tolerance on the computed bearing capacity: When the
      bearing stress under the footing(s) from one increment to the next
      has a relative change (max-norm) of less than this tolerance, or is
      starting to decrease, the bearing capacity is assumed to have been
      reached and the displacement steps are discontinued.

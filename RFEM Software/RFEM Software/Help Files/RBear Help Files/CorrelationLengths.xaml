        The following discussion refers to random processes having `short memory'
correlation structures (see, for example, dlavx2, dlsep2, or dlspx2).  The
class of random processes having infinite correlation lengths, such as fractal
processes (see, for example, dlafr2 and dlsfr2), are characterized by
parameters other than the correlation length, also called the `scale of
fluctuation'.  However, `short memory' random processes are preferable because
they have finite variance, and so are physically realizable.

   A `correlation length' or `scale of fluctuation' is, roughly speaking,
the separation distance beyond which soil properties at two points are
negligibly correlated. For example, if the correlation length is 5.0 m,
then the soil properties at two points separated by 10 m are pretty well
statistically independent (ie, one does not affect the other). On the other
hand, the soil properties at two points separated by only 1.0 m will be
reasonably highly correlated, so that if one is large, for example, the
other will also tend to be large.

   Small correlation lengths result in random fields which are very erratic,
while large correlation lengths result in random fields which are `smoother'
and more slowly varying (at least at some resolutions).

   In general, the correlation lengths can be different in the two orthogonal
directions (horizontally and vertically). Since soils are often layered
horizontally, the correlation length in the horizontal direction is generally
larger than in the vertical direction (that is, soil properties will often be
more `persistent' in the horizontal direction). Note that the Local Average
Subdivision simulation method used by this program involves an approximation
to the true joint distribution that tends to be reasonably accurate only when
the ratio of the larger correlation length to the smaller is less than about
10.

   Because there is some evidence that soil properties are actually fractal in
nature (statistically self-similar at a variety of scales), then, if in doubt,
one rule of thumb is to choose correlation lengths which are about 1/10 to
1/4 of the size of the soil regime in each direction. For example, if the soil
mass being modeled is of depth 5.0 m and width 40.0 m, one might choose the
vertical correlation length to be 0.5 m, and the horizontal scale of
fluctuation to be 10.0 m.

   Notes:
        1) the mathematical definition of the correlation length used in
           this program is the area under the correlation function from
           minus infinity to plus infinity. Some definitions of `correlation
           length' involve only the positive half of the area, and so
           differ from this definition by a factor of 2.
        2) setting a correlation length to zero results (theoretically)
           in a white noise process. Such a process is physically
           unrealizable, since it has infinite variance, and the numerical
           simulation will fail. If independence between properties in each
           finite element is desired, it is generally sufficient to set the
           correlation length to some value quite a bit smaller than the
           element size. Remember, however, that the variance of the local
           average over the element size is very dependent on the correlation
           length (as the length decreases, the variance of the average
           also decreases). Thus, setting the correlation length to a
           very small number may result in a simulation with very little
           variability at the finite element scale.

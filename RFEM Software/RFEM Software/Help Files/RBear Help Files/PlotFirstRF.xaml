        Enabling this option will cause the first random field (ie. the first
realization) to be plotted as a DISPLAY format file having extension
*.fld. It can be post-processed by display.exe to produce a PostScript
plot which can then be view using Ghostview. See also the Results menu.
Note that since there are 5 possible soil property fields to choose from,
the soil property type to display may also be specified here. The type
must be one of `cohesion', `friction angle', `dilation angle', `Poisson's
ratio', or `Elastic modulus'. Normally only random fields are selected to
display (non-random fields are pretty boring to look at).

    <Paragraph>
        The bearing capacity analysis, being nonlinear, is performed by means of
two iterations. The main iteration involves gradually displacing the
footing into the soil until the soil `fails' by no longer being able to
pick up increased loads. The distance the footing is advanced downwards
into the soil on each step is called the displacement increment.
The second iteration is performed for each displacement increment and
involves distributing the plastic flow of the soil (when it exceeds its
elastic limit) until the nodal displacements stabilize.

On this line, two integers are defined to limit the program and prevent
a runaway analysis that never converges. These integers are defined as
follows;

  i) `maxst' is the maximum number of displacement increments that may be
     carried out. If the bearing capacity is not find prior to maxst
     displacement steps, an error message is issued to the *.stt output
     file. The displacement increment should be selected so that the
     number of displacement steps required to achieve bearing capacity
     failure is about 10 (see Help for the Displacement Increment). A
     maximum value of 50, for reasonable levels of variability, should be
     sufficient if the deterministic number of displacement increments
     is around 10.

 ii) `maxit' is the maximum number of iterations allowed for the plastic
     flow redistribution which is carried out at each displacement
     increment. A maximum value of about 300 has been found to be
     reasonable in most cases.

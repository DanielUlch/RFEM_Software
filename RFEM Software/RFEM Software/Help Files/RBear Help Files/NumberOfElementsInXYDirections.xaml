        The soil medium is divided into a grid of rectangular finite elements
according to the following scheme

      |--------------------------- nxe --------------------------->|

where nxe is the number of elements in the x-direction and nye is the
number of elements in the y-direction. These two values are specified
on this line.

The following finite element features also apply;

      - left and right boundaries are fixed in the x-direction and therefore
        only allow movement in the (vertical) y-direction.
      - the bottom boundary is completely fixed and therefore there is no
        movement allowed along this boundary.
      - the top boundary is the ground level and is free to deform under the
        application of the footing loads.
      - loads and displacements are positive in the downwards direction
      - up to two footings may be specified -- these act at the soil surface.

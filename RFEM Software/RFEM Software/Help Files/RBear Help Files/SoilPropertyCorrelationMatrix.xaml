    <Paragraph>
        The correlation coefficients, acting between each random soil
property, can be defined in the following table. For example,
if the correlation coefficient between `cohesion' and
`friction angle' is -0.4, then the 2nd box from the left on
the top line of boxes would be edited to contain the string
`-0.4'. Only non-zero correlation coefficients need to be
specified in the table. Also the correlation coefficient between
a soil property and itself is 1.0, so the diagonal elements of
the table are held fixed at 1.0 and cannot be changed.

Note that the correlation coefficient(s) are assumed to act
between the underlying normally distributed random fields from
which the soil properties are eventually obtained. For example,
suppose that the correlation coefficient between `friction
angle' and `elastic modulus' is set to 0.4. Further, suppose that
the friction angle, phi, is assumed normally distributed and the
elastic modulus, e, is assumed lognormally distributed. Then the
prescribed correlation coefficient of 0.4 is assumed to act
between phi and ln(e), since ln(e) is normally distributed.

The correlation coefficients used in this program can be
estimated from real data by converting the data to its assumed
underlying normal distribution. That is, if a soil property is
assumed to be lognormally distributed, then statistical
analyses designed to estimate a correlation coefficient or
correlation length should be performed using the natural
logarithm of the data. Similarly, if an observed soil property,
say x_1, x_2, ..., x_n, is assumed to follow a bounded 
distribution (using the distribution assumed in this program
with location parameter, m, equal to 0 so that the distribution
is symmetric about the midpoint of its bounds), then statistical
analyses for the correlation structure should be done using the
data y_1, y_2, ... y_n, derived from

   y = pi*ln[(x-a)/(b-x)]

where `a' is the lower bound on the distribution and `b' is the
upper bound. Note that the above relationship should also be
used to produce the data to estimate the scale parameter, `s',
for the bounded distribution.

In practice, there is much uncertainty about the precise value
of the correlation coefficient between two soil properties.
Thus, it may not be worth worrying about the often slight
changes in correlation arising from the non-linear
transformations between the underlying normal distribution and
the specified distribution (eg., lognormal or bounded, see
above). If in doubt, just specify the correlation coefficient
that has been estimated between the two properties from
measured field properties or as reported in the literature.
Given the usual estimation errors arising from insufficient
data, worrying about non-linear transformation details is
probably not justified.

Finally, it should be pointed out that the prescribed
correlation coefficient is assumed to act between one property
at a point and a second property at the same point. That is,
the complete cross-correlation matrix between all points of
the first property and all points of the second property cannot
be specified here. Again, given the level of knowledge about
correlation coefficients between soil properties, this
`pointwise' correlation structure is more than sufficient.

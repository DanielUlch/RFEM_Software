        On this line, three integers, referred to here as `nfound', `nfoot',
and `ngap' are specified. These are described as follows;

  i) `nfound' denotes the number of footings applied to the surface
     of the soil mass. It can take values 1 or 2. If nfound = 1, then
     the value of ngap is ignored. See below for an nfound = 2 example.

 ii) `nfoot' gives the number of elements, in the x-direction, under
     the footing. If there are two footings, each is assumed to have
     width nfoot elements. The physical width of a footing is
     equal to nfoot*dx.

iii) `ngap' gives the number of elements, in the x-direction, between
     the two footings when nfound = 2. If nfound = 1, this parameter
     is ignored. The footings are otherwise centered on the soil mass.


                                 nfound = 2
